## Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of a class and only exposing what is necessary. It protects data by keeping variables private and allowing access through public methods (getters/setters).

## Abstraction
Abstraction means showing only the important features and hiding the complex details. It helps to simplify the interaction with objects by exposing only relevant methods.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent). It helps to reuse code and create a hierarchy.

## Tuple
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items in Python. Once created, its elements cannot be changed.
```
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

##  __init__ Method
__init__ is a special method in Python classes. It initializes the objectâ€™s attributes when an instance is created.
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

 MRO (Method Resolution Order)
MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes (especially with multiple inheritance). It decides which method to call first.

You can check MRO by:
```
print(ClassName.mro())
```

## Multiprocessing
Multiprocessing allows a program to run multiple processes at the same time, using multiple CPU cores. It helps improve performance by parallel execution.

## SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data with commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
